<!-- Slide: Conda Overview -->
## Conda: A Different Approach

* **Conda** (2012): Package, dependency and environment manager for any language
  * **Key difference**: Manages non-Python dependencies and binary packages
  * **Environment isolation**: Complete environment management with `conda env`
  * **Package ecosystem**: Uses Anaconda repository, not PyPI
  * **Mamba/Micromamba** (2019): Faster C++ reimplementation of conda

> *Conda operates in a parallel ecosystem to pip/PyPI, focusing on scientific computing and cross-language dependencies*
